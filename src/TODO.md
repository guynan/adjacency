# To do

- Implement arc queries; e.g tree, forward, back, cross

- Implement BFS 

- Support node labeling with letters and improve the zero node implementation

- Import from csv adjacency matrix 

- Query vertices for density, order, degree, whether or not is source or sink

- Work out how to implement checking if it is source in less than O(n)
